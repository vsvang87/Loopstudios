I built this landing page from frontendmentor.io. It was a challenge that I completed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I use HTML to structure, CSS for layouts, design and responsiveness. 
I use JavaScript for mobile menu function to toggle open and close.
Overall it was good experience to work on my grid and flexbox layout and overlapping elements as well.
It also help me to work on building mobile menu.
